Though, types could either be specified while code editing by the coder (Eg. C, Java), or it can be inferred at compile time (Eg. C++11, Haskell). Hence, after compile-time, every variable is bound to one fixed type, making this statement [TRUE]\r\n\r\n<strong>(B)</strong> According to one definition, un-type languages store values in form of bits, thus neither variables nor values have any types associated to them.

The less time you spend moving your heads across the disk, the more continuous reads/writes per second. The smaller the block size, the more frequent it is required to move before a read/write can occur. Larger block size means less number of blocks to fetch and hence better throughput.

As opposed to call-by-value, it only evaluates the argument given to a function when it is need, and caches it for further use. Call-by-name is a bit different from call-by-need in the sense that it evaluates in the lazy fashion only but doesn’t cache the calculated value. Hence, call-by-need requires to evaluate once if the argument is being used, call-by-value needs to evaluate it no matter if the argument is used or not, and call-by-name evaluates the same argument multiple times as and when it is used.\r\n\r\n<strong>Explanation :</strong>\r\n\r\nValue of variable x doesn’t change anytime in the function P(x). Hence, whatever its value is when this function is called, only that will be used in all the print statements. Clearly, 100+5+10, 100+5 i.e. 115, 105 will be printed by the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solution is contributed by <strong>vineet purswani </strong>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Another Solution:</strong>\r\n\r\nHere in main function P(i+j) function is called with arguments values i =100 and j = 5(since static scoping).Now when P(100+5) is called, here in P function, j is a free variable and i is a local variable.Now take a look at the steps in P function :\r\n\r\n<strong>step_1:</strong> Local variable i is initialized to value 0.\r\n\r\n<strong>step_2:</strong> Here value of x+10 is printed and since it’s call by need,so value of x is calculated to 105 and it’s stored in cache for further use.Also 115 is printed here.\r\n\r\n<strong>step_3:</strong> Now, i is assigned value 200.\r\n\r\n<strong>step_4:</strong> Here, j is a free variable, So it’s scope is searched in immediate outer block until we find variable j’s declaration.Global variable j’s value is changed from 5 to 20.\r\n\r\n<strong>step_5:</strong> x value is printed as 105.Since it’s uses the cache stored value of x.\r\n\r\nThe output would be similar to C programming language as <a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-16/\" target=\"_blank\">C does static scoping</a> only.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solution is contributed by  <strong>Nirmal

Consider process P and Q.\r\nSay P utilizes 5ms of CPU and then Q utilizes 5ms of CPU. Hence after 15ms P starts with I/O And after 20ms Q also starts with I/O. Since I/O can be done in parallel, P finishes I\\O at 105th ms (15 + 90) and Q finishes its I\\O at 110th ms (20 + 90). Therefore we can see that CPU remains idle from 20th to 105th ms.\r\nThat is when Round Robin scheduling is used,\r\nIdle time of CPU = 85ms\r\nCPU Utilization = 20/105 = 19.05%\r\n\r\nWhen First Come First Served scheduling scheduling or Shortest Remaining Time First is used\r\nSay P utilizes 10ms of CPU and then starts its I/O.

Hence,\r\nIdle time of CPU = 80ms\r\nCPU Utilization = 20/100 = 20%\r\n\r\nSince only two processes are involved and I\\O time is much more than CPU time, \"Static priority scheduling with different priorities\" for the two processes reduces to FCFS or Shortest remaining time first.\r\nTherefore, Round robin will result in least CPU utilization.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"http://gateoverflow.in/963/gateoverflow.in\">http://gateoverflow.in/963/gateoverflow.in</a>"},{"id":3750,"question":"A processor uses 2-level page tables for virtual to physical address translation.
