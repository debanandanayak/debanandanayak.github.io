To qualify as a group, the set and operation, (G, •), must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms:\r\n\r\nClosure\r\nFor all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a • b, is also in G.b\r\n\r\nAssociativity\r\nFor all a, b and c in G, (a • b) • c = a • (b • c).\r\n\r\nIdentity element\r\nThere exists an element e in G, such that for every element a in G, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. Such an element is unique (see below), and thus one speaks of the identity element.\r\n\r\nInverse element\r\nFor each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a • b = b • a = e, where e is the identity element.\r\nThe result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands. In other words, the result of combining element a with element b need not yield the same result as combining element b with element a; the equation\r\n\r\na • b = b • a\r\nmay not always be true. This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition, because a + b = b + a for any two integers (commutativity of addition). Groups for which the commutativity equation a • b = b • a always holds are called abelian groups (in honor of Niels Abel)\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)</a></p>"},{"id":4944,"question":"<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the chromatic number of an n-vertex simple connected graph which does not contain any odd length cycle?

Here's an explanation for the ranking of coupling between modules from strongest (least desirable) to weakest (most desirable) as given in option (A) - I-II-III-IV-V:</p><p>I. Content coupling: This form of coupling represents the strongest and least desirable type. It occurs when one module directly accesses or modifies the internal content (e.g., data or implementation details) of another module. Content coupling creates tight dependencies, making the modules highly interdependent, which can lead to maintenance issues and difficulties in making changes.</p><p>II. Common coupling: Common coupling occurs when multiple modules share a global data or resource. This form of coupling implies that several modules rely on the same data or resource, leading to a degree of dependency. While not as strong as content coupling, it can still result in tight coupling between modules.</p><p>III. Control coupling: Control coupling represents a weaker form of coupling. It arises when one module passes control information (e.g., function calls or parameters) to another module. While there is still a dependency between the modules, it is looser than content or common coupling since the interaction is primarily through control flow.</p><p>IV. Stamp coupling: Stamp coupling occurs when modules share a common data structure (e.g., a record or object), but only use a subset of the shared data. This type of coupling indicates a weaker level of dependency compared to content, common, or control coupling since modules are only interested in specific parts of the shared data.</p><p>V. Data coupling: Data coupling represents the weakest and most desirable form of coupling. In data coupling, modules communicate by passing data through parameters or data structures. Modules are independent in terms of their internal implementation, and their interaction is limited to data exchange. This loose coupling allows for more flexibility and easier maintenance.</p><p>Therefore, the ranking of coupling from strongest (least desirable) to weakest (most desirable) as given in option (A) is I-II-III-IV-V, with content coupling being the strongest and data coupling being the weakest form of coupling.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"/software-engineering-gq/\">Quiz of this Question</a><br>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":4957,"question":"Consider the HTML t able definition given below:<pre>\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" data-iceapw=\"58\" data-iceapc=\"19\">\r\n<tbody data-iceapw=\"58\" data-iceapc=\"18\">\r\n<tr data-iceapw=\"54\" data-iceapc=\"2\">\r\n<td valign=\"top\" data-iceapw=\"53\">&lt; table border=1&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td rowspan=2&gt; ab &lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td colspan=2&gt; cd &lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt; ef &lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td rowspan=2&gt; gh &lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td colspan=2&gt; ik &lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table></pre>\r\nThe number of rows in each column and the number of columns in each row are:","answers":[{"id":20126,"answer":"(2, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 2)","correct":false},{"id":20127,"answer":"(2, 2, 3) and (2, 2, 3)","correct":false},{"id":20128,"answer":"(2, 3, 2) and (2, 3, 2)","correct":true},{"id":20129,"answer":"(2, 3, 2) and (2, 2, 3)","correct":false}],"explanation":"cd\r\n\r\nab ef\r\n\r\nij gh\r\n\r\nab -&gt; rowspan \"2\"\r\n\r\ncd -&gt; colspan \"2\"\r\n\r\n1st row closed\r\n\r\n&lt;tr&gt; is row\r\n\r\n&lt;td&gt; is data\r\n\r\nef placed in 2nd row. gh is in same row but rowspan \"2\"\r\n\r\n2nd row also closed.\r\n\r\nMove to 3rd row.
