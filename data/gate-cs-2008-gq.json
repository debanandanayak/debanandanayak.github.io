After one complete derivation we get a string w which consists of only terminal symbols, i.e. w belongs to L(G). Then we can say that w is a sentence of the Grammar G. Now, while the derivation process, if it gets some form q, where q may contain some Non-terminal then we say that q is a sentential form of the Grammar G. Even the start symbol S is also the sentential form of the Grammar G ( because it also contains Non-terminal S). <pre>\r\n\r\nFor Ex :\r\n\r\nGrammar is :\r\n\r\nS-> aAcBe\r\n\r\nA->Ab|b\r\n\r\nB->d\r\n\r\nInput string : abbcde\r\n\r\nDerivation : ( Top-Down, Right Most Derivation)\r\n\r\nS->aAcBe\r\n->aAcde\r\n->aAbcde\r\n->abbcde </pre>\r\n\r\nHere { abbcde } is the sentence of the Grammar( because it contains only terminal symbols), and { S, aAcBe, aAcde, aAbcde } are the sentential forms of the G ( because these forms contain non-terminals during the derivation process )\r\n\r\nNow, let's look at the question.\r\n\r\nThe question is related to LR parsing which is a bottom-up parsing.\r\n\r\nLet's take the same grammar above, as it is a bottom up parsing we need to start from the string \"abbcde\" and try to get S using production rules. <pre>\r\n\r\n: abbcde\r\n\r\n->aAbcde ( using A-> b )\r\n\r\n->aAcde ( using A-> Ab )\r\n\r\n->aAcBe ( using B -> d )\r\n\r\n->S ( using S-> aAcBe ) </pre>\r\n\r\nThe above process is called reduction.\r\n\r\nThe RHS of the Production which is being replaced by their LHS is called Handle, So , { b, Ab, d, aAcBe} are handles, and replacing it with its LHS is called Handle-Pruning.\r\n\r\nHence option D suits best.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdMTs93sekg?start=835\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n"},{"id":6170,"question":"Some code optimizations are carried out on the intermediate code because","answers":[{"id":24821,"answer":"they enhance the portability of the compiler to other target processors","correct":true},{"id":24822,"answer":"program analysis is more accurate on intermediate code than on machine code","correct":false},{"id":24823,"answer":"the information from dataflow analysis cannot otherwise be used for optimization","correct":false},{"id":24824,"answer":" the information from the front end cannot otherwise be used for optimization","correct":false}],"explanation":"Option (B) is also true.

So a compiler can optimize it without worrying about the architecture on which the code is going to execute (it may be the same or the other ).

Exceptions are broadly classified into 3 main categories:\r\na. Interrupt: it is mainly caused due to I/O device.\r\nb. Trap: It is caused by the program making a syscall.\r\nc. Fault: It is accidentally caused by the program that is under execution such as( a divide by zero, or null pointer exception etc).\r\n\r\nThe processor’s fetch instruction unit makes a poll for the interrupts. If it finds something unusual happening in the machine operation it inserts an interrupt pseudo- instruction in the pipeline in place of the normal instruction. Then going through the pipeline it starts handling the interrupts. The operating system explicitly makes a transition from kernel mode to user mode, generally at the end of an interrupt handle pr kernel call by using a privileged instruction RFE( Return From Exception) instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solution is contributed by <strong>Namita Singh</strong>\r\n</p>"},{"id":6385,"question":"For inclusion to hold between two cache levels L1 and L2 in a multi-level cache hierarchy, which of the following are necessary? <pre>\r\nI.

This is called an <i>access link</i> or <i>static link</i> (as it keeps track of static nesting during dynamic and recursive calls) and provides the routine (as well as any other routines it may invoke) access to the local data of its encapsulating routines at every nesting level. Some architectures, compilers, or optimization cases store one link for each enclosing level (not just the immediately enclosing), so that deeply nested routines that access shallow data do not have to traverse several links; this strategy is often called a \"display\"  [Source:  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack</a> ]\r\n\r\nIII.

And LALR(1) states can be find by merging LR(1) states of LR(1) parser that have the same set of first components of their items.\r\n\r\ni.e. if LR(1) parser has 2 states I and J with items A->a.bP,x and A->a.bP,y respectively, where x and y are look ahead symbols, then as these items are same with respect to their first component, they can be merged together and form one single state, let's say K. Here we have to take union of look ahead symbols. After merging, State K will have one single item as A->a.bP,x,y . This way LALR(1) states are formed ( i.e. after merging the states of LR(1) ).\r\n\r\nNow, S-R conflict in LR(1) items can be there whenever a state has items of the form :<pre>\r\n\r\nA-> a.bB , p\r\nC-> d. , b\r\n\r\ni.e. it is getting both shift and reduce at symbol b, \r\nhence a conflict. </pre>\r\n\r\nNow, as LALR(1) have items similar to LR(1) in terms of their first component, shift-reduce form will only take place if it is already there in LR(1) states. If there is no S-R conflict in LR(1) state it will never be reflected in the LALR(1) state obtained by combining LR(1) states.\r\n\r\nNote: But this process of merging may introduce R-R conflict, and then the Grammar won't be LALR(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdMTs93sekg?start=1015\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":6678,"question":"In the slow start phase of the TCP congestion control algorithm, the size of the congestion window","answers":[{"id":26830,"answer":" does not increase","correct":false},{"id":26831,"answer":"increases linearly","correct":false},{"id":26832,"answer":"increases quadratically","correct":false},{"id":26833,"answer":"increases exponentially ","correct":true}],"explanation":"<p>See Question 2 of <a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks-set-7/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks-set-7/</a></p>"},{"id":7285,"question":"If a class B network on the Internet has a subnet mask of 255.255.248.0, what is the maximum number of hosts per subnet?","answers":[{"id":29258,"answer":"1022","correct":false},{"id":29259,"answer":"1023","correct":false},{"id":29260,"answer":"2046","correct":true},{"id":29261,"answer":"2047","correct":false}],"explanation":"<p>See Question 3 of <a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks-set-7/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks-set-7/</a></p>"},{"id":7286,"question":"A computer on a 10Mbps network is regulated by a token bucket.

must hold for non-sharable resources.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Hold and Wait</strong> – must guarantee that whenever a process requests a resource, it does not hold any other resources. Require process to request and be allocated all its sources before it begins execution, or allow process to request resources only when the process has none. Low resource utilization; starvation possible. Restrain the ways request can be made.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>No Pre-emption</strong> – If a process that is holding some resources requests another resource that cannot be immediately allocated to it, and then all resources currently being held are released. Pre-empted resources are added to the list of resources for which the process is waiting. Process will be restarted only when it can regain its old resources, as well as the new ones that it is requesting.\r\n\r\n4. <strong>Circular Wait</strong> – impose a total ordering of all resource types, and require that each process requests resources in an increasing order of enumeration.\r\n\r\n<strong>Deadlock Avoidance:</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen a scheduler sees that starting a process or granting resource requests may lead to future deadlocks, then that process is just not started or the request is not granted. The deadlock-avoidance algorithm dynamically examines the resource-allocation state to ensure that there can never be a circular-wait condition. Resource-allocation state is defined by the number of available and allocated resources, and the maximum demands of the processes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Choice of the question:</strong>\r\n\r\n(A) In deadlock prevention, the request for resources is always granted if the resulting state is safe. false, Deadlock prevention scheme handles deadlock by making sure that one of the four necessary conditions don't occur. In deadlock prevention, the request for a resource may not be granted even if the resulting state is safe.\r\n\r\n(B) In deadlock avoidance, the request for resources is always granted if the result state is safe. true, As in Deadlock avoidance, if resultant state is safe than request for resource is granted as being in a safe state, it can hold other resources now.\r\n\r\n(C) Deadlock avoidance is less restrictive than deadlock prevention. true, As in Deadlock prevention, request for a resource may not be granted even if the resulting state is safe. but in deadlock avoidance, request for a resource is granted if the resulting state is safe.\r\n\r\n(D) Deadlock avoidance requires knowledge of resource requirements a priori true, deadlock avoidance checks any chance of deadlock means even if the system is in safe state, it checks that after allocating requested resource, the system is not in deadlocked state. So deadlock avoidance requires knowledge of resource requirements a priori.\r\n\r\nSee Question 2 of <a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems-set-11/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems-set-11/</a>\r\n\r\nThis solution is contributed by  <strong>Nitika Bansal</strong>\r\n\r\n"},{"id":6792,"question":"<p>What is the maximum size of data that the application layer can pass on to the TCP layer below?<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20211202174742/Capture262-300x119.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"119\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-726141\" /></p>","answers":[{"id":27286,"answer":"A","correct":true},{"id":27287,"answer":"B","correct":false},{"id":27288,"answer":"C","correct":false},{"id":27289,"answer":"D","correct":false}],"explanation":"The default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.
