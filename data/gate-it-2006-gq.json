st;</pre>\r\n\r\nst is a array of structures in which the integer is the “i” variable of structure and the character array is the “c” variable of structure.\r\n\r\np is a pointer of structure test type which is pointing to the array of structures (first element). p contains the base address of first structure in st array i.e { 5, become}.\r\n\r\n<pre>p += 1;</pre>\r\n\r\nThis statement increments p by one which means p now point to the next structure (because p is pointer of type structure test, so on incrementing it by one it will jump one structure). p now points to {4, better}.\r\n\r\nBefore moving on to further statements we first discuss about the <a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-operator-precedence-associativity/\">operators and their precedence</a>.  \r\n\r\n“->” is structure operator which gets the member of the structure being referred. It has higher priority than increment/decrement (++, --) and dereferencing operation (*).\r\n\r\nNow a brief discussion about post increment and pre increment operator.\r\n\r\nPre-increment operator is used to increment the value of variable before using in the expression. In the Pre-Increment value is first incremented and then used inside the expression.\r\n\r\nPost-increment operator is used to increment the value of variable as soon as after executing expression completely in which post increment is used. In the Post-Increment value is first used in a expression and then incremented.\r\n\r\n<pre> ++p -> c; </pre>\r\n \r\nIn this statement the structure operator (higher priority) will first make p point to the c variable inside the structure. Now pointer is inside the character array, now incrementing the pointer in character array ‘c’ will jump one character in character array. Hence the character array now starts from “e”.\r\n\r\n<strong>p->c</strong> moves pointer inside the structure to the variable “c”.\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>printf(\"%s,\", p++ -> c);</pre>\r\n\r\nIn this statement there is post increment operator used. First the statement will be executed and then operator will work. Currently p is pointing to second structure { 4, better} and inside structure the character array is starting from e because of the previous statement so p->c will print the string “etter” and after that the post increment operator will increment the structure and p now will point to next structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>printf(\"%c,\", *++p -> c);</pre>\r\nIn this statement p->c points to “jungle” (p was currently pointing to 3rd structure {6, jungle}) and then the pre incrementing operator just like in previous pre increment statement moves one character and now the pointer points to “u”, dereferencing operator here prints the value at the address where the pointer is pointing and since the pointer is pointing at “u” so u is printed.\r\n\r\n<pre>printf(\"%d,\", p[0].i);</pre>\r\n\r\nIn this statement p[0] will give the address where p is currently pointing i.e {6, jungle} and the structure operator (.) will point to the “i” variable of the structure printing 6 as a result.\r\n\r\n<pre>printf(\"%s \\\\n\", p -> c);</pre>\r\n\r\nThis statements prints the character string of the structure to which p is currently pointing and since because of earlier increment of character array, character array starts from “u” therefore “ungle” is printed.\r\n\r\nThis explanation has been contributed by <strong>Parul Sharma.</strong>\n"},{"id":7758,"question":"Which one of
