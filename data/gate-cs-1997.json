The timestamps are monotonically increasing with time. Let us denote the timestamp of a process P by TS(P).\r\n\r\nWhen a process P requests for a resource the OS does the following:\r\n<pre><em>(i)</em> If no other process is currently holding the resource, the OS awards the resource to P.\r\n<em>(ii)</em> If some process Q with<em> TS(Q)&lt;TS(P)</em> is holding the resource, the OS makes P wait for \r\n     the resources.\r\n<em>(iii)</em> If some process Q with <em>TS(Q)&gt;TS(P)</em> is holding the resource, the OS restarts Q \r\n      and awards the resources to P.\r\n<em>(Restarting means taking back the resources held by a process, killing it and starting it \r\nagain with the same timestamp)</em>\r\n</pre>\r\nWhen a process releases a resource, the process with the smallest timestamp (if any) amongst those waiting for the resource is awarded the resource.\r\n<em>a)</em>.
