Each monomial involves a maximum of one multiplication and one addition processes. The result obtained from one monomial is added to the result obtained from the next monomial and so forth in an accumulative addition fashion. To explain the above, let is re-write the polynomial in its expanded form;\r\n\r\nf(x0) = a0 + a1x0+ a2x0^2+ ... + anx0^n\r\n\r\nThis can, also, be written as:\r\n\r\nf(x0) = a0 + x0(a1+ x0(a2+ x0(a3+ ... + (an-1 + anx0)....)\r\n\r\nThe algorithm proposed by this rule is based on evaluating the monomials formed above starting\r\nfrom the one in the inner-most parenthesis and move out to evaluate the monomials in the outer\r\nparenthesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Solution :</strong>\r\nUsing Horner's Rule, we can write the polynomial as following\r\na0 + (a1 + (a2 + a3x)x)x\r\n\r\nIn the above form, we need to do only 3 multiplications <pre>\r\n\r\np = a3 X x    ------------ (1)\r\n\r\nq = (a2 + p) X x  ---------(2)\r\n\r\nr = (a1 + q) X x  ---------(3)\r\n\r\nresult = a0 + r </pre>\r\n\r\n\r\nReference :\r\n<a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/horners-method-polynomial-evaluation/\">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/horners-method-polynomial-evaluation/</a>\r\nThis solution is contributed by <strong>Nitika Bansal.</strong>"},{"id":5366,"question":"<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Let X, Y, Z be sets of sizes x, y and z respectively.

In this scheduling algorithm, the process with the smallest amount of time remaining until completion is selected to execute.

Checkpoint declares a point before which the DBMS was in consistent state, and all the transactions were committed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Recovery:</strong>\r\nWhen a system with concurrent transactions crashes and recovers, it behaves in the following manner −\r\n\r\n=>The recovery system reads the logs backwards from the end to the last checkpoint.\r\n\r\n=>It maintains two lists, an undo-list and a redo-list.\r\n\r\n=>If the recovery system sees a log with <tn, start=\"\"> and <tn, commit=\"\"> or just <tn, commit=\"\">, it puts the transaction in the redo-list.\r\n\r\n=>If the recovery system sees a log with <tn, start=\"\"> but no commit or abort log found, it puts the transaction in undo-list.\r\n\r\nAll the transactions in the undo-list are then undone and their logs are removed. All the transactions in the redo-list and their previous logs are removed and then redone before saving their logs.\r\n\r\nSo Answer is B redo log records 2 and 3 and undo log record 6</p>"},{"id":5291,"question":"For each element in a set of size 2n, an unbiased coin is tossed.

So π is a function from N to N, which just permutes the elements of N, so there will be n! such permutations. Now given a particular π i.e. given a particular permutation scheme, we have to find number of permutations out of these n! permuations in which minimum elements of A and B after applying π to them are same.\r\nSo for example, if N = {1,2,3}, π is {2,3,1}, and if A is {1,3}, then π(A) = {2,1}.\r\nNow number of elements in A ∪ B is |A ∪ B|. We can choose permutations for A ∪ B in nC|A∪B| ways. Note that here we are just choosing elements for permutation, and not actually permuting. Let this chosen set be P. Now once we have chosen numbers for permutations, we have to select mapping from each element of A ∪ B to some element of P.\r\nSo first of all, to achieve required condition specified in question, we have to map minimum number in P to any of the number in A ∩ B, so that min(π(A)) = min(π(B)). We can do this in |A∩B| ways, since we can choose any element of |A∩B| to be mapped to minimum number in P.\r\nNow we come to permutation. We can permute numbers in P in |A∪B-1|! ways, since one number (minimum) is already fixed.\r\nMoreover, we can also permute remaining n - |A∪B-1| in (n - |A∪B-1|)! ways, so total no. of ways =\r\nnC|A∪B|∗|A∩B|∗|A∪B−1|!∗(n−|A∪B−1|)!=n!|A∩B||A∪B|\r\nSo option (C) is correct.\r\nNote: Some answer keys on web have shown answer as option (D), which is clearly incorrect.

Next, the root sends out (one or more) data units to enable the setting up of the spanning tree of shortest paths from the root bridge to each bridge.\r\nEach bridge identifies a port (the root port) through which it will forward frames to the root bridge. Port conflicts are always resolved in favour of the port with the lower index value. When there is a possibility of multiple bridges forwarding to the same LAN (but not through the root port), ties are broken as follows: bridges closest to the root get preference and between such bridges, the one with the lowest serial number is preferred.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2014/09/cs200682.gif\"><img alt=\"cs200682\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13535\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2014/09/cs200682.gif\" width=\"500\"/></a>\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the given connection of LANs by bridges, which one of the following choices represents the depth first traversal of the spanning tree of bridges?</p>","answers":[{"id":12759,"answer":" B1, B5, B3, B4, B2","correct":true},{"id":12760,"answer":"B1, B3, B5, B2, B4","correct":false},{"id":12761,"answer":"B1, B5, B2, B3, B4","correct":false},{"id":12762,"answer":"B1, B3, B4, B5, B2 ","correct":false}],"explanation":"Spanning tree is\r<pre>\r\n                B1\r\n                /  \\\\\r\n              /      \\\\\r\n             B5      B3\r\n                     /  \\\\\r\n                   /     \\\\\r\n                  B4     B2 \n</pre>\r\rNote that B4 and B2 are connected through B3 (Not B5) because B3 has lower serial number than B5.\r\rOne DFS traversal of tree is B1 B5 B3 B4 B2\r\rHence Option A is the Answer\r"},{"id":3071,"question":"Consider the data given in<a href=\"http://geeksquiz.com/gate-gate-cs-2006-question-82/\" target=\"_blank\"> above question</a>.\r\n\r\nConsider the correct spanning tree for the previous question.
