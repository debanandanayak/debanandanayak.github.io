Delimiters are used to define the beginning and end of data.\r\nSince delimiters are special bit-patterns used for special purposes, they must be avoided in the encoded form of the input data. To achieve this, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_stuffing\" target=\"_blank\">Bit Stuffing</a> is used.\r\nOn the sending side, any time five consecutive 1's have been transmitted from the body of the message (i.e., excluding when the sender is trying to transmit the distinguished 01111110 delimiter sequence), the sender inserts a 0 before transmitting the next bit. \r\nIf the receiver gets five consecutive 1's, it makes its decision based on the next bit it sees (i.e., the bit following the five 1s). \r\nIf the next bit is a 0, it must have been stuffed, and so the receiver removes it. \r\nIf the next bit is a 1, then one of two things is true: Either this is the end-of-frame marker or an error has been introduced into the bit stream.\r\nGoing further and reading the next bit distinguishes these two cases. If the next bit is 0, then it is the end of frame marker (delimiter 01111110), and if the next bit is a 1 then there is must be an error in the frame and it is discarded.\r\nSo, For the data sequence 0111111101\r\nEncoding would be - 011111<strong>0</strong>1101\r\nHere the bold 0 is stuffed to distinguish it from the delimiter sequence.\r\nComing back to the question, the encoded string is - 01111100101 and when the receiver senses that it has received 5 consecutive 1's then \r\nIf the next bit is 0, then it is stuffed\r\nIf the next bit is 1, then next to next bit would tell if the frame has ended or there is an error.\r\nIn this case, the next bit is 0 which means it was stuffed, so the corresponding input sequence is- 0111110101.\r\nTherefore, option (B) is correct.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is provided by <strong>Chirag Manwani</strong>.\r\n "},{"id":6604,"question":"Host A (on TCP/IP v4 network A) sends an IP datagram D to host B (also on TCP/IP v4 network B).

In Virtual memory systems, the cpu generates virtual memory addresses. But, the data is stored in actual physical memory i.e. we need to place a physical memory address on the memory bus to fetch the data from the memory circuitry. So, a special table is maintained by the operating system called the Page table. This table contains a mapping between the virtual addresses and physical addresses. So, every time a cpu generates a virtual address, the operating system page table has to be looked up to find the corresponding physical address. To speed this up, there is hardware support called the TLB. The TLB is a high speed cache of the page table i.e. contains recently accessed virtual to physical translations. TLB hit ratio- A TLB hit is the no of times a virtual-to-physical address translation was already found in the TLB, instead of going all the way to the page table which is located in slower physical memory. TLB hit ratio is nothing but the ratio of TLB hits/Total no of queries into TLB. In the case that the page is found in the TLB (TLB hit) the total time would be the time of search in the TLB plus the time to access memory, so\r\n\r\n <strong>TLB_hit_time := TLB_search_time + memory_access_time</strong>\r\n \r\nIn the case that the page is not found in the TLB (TLB miss) the total time would be the time to search the TLB (you don't find anything, but searched nontheless) plus the time to access memory to get the page table and frame, plus the time to access memory to get the data, so\r\n\r\n<strong>TLB_miss_time := TLB_search_time + memory_access_time + memory_access_time</strong>\r\nBut this is in individual cases, when you want to know an average measure of the TLB performance, you use the Effective Access Time, that is the weighted average of the previous measures\r\n\r\nEAT := TLB_miss_time * (1- hit_ratio) + TLB_hit_time * hit_ratio.\r\n\r\nEAT := (TLB_search_time + 2*memory_access_time) * (1- hit_ratio) + (TLB_search_time + memory_access_time)* hit_ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>As both page table and page are in physical memory\r\nT(eff) = hit ratio * (TLB access time + Main memory access time) + \r\n         (1 - hit ratio) * (TLB access time + 2 * main memory time)\r\n       = 0.6*(10+80) + (1-0.6)*(10+2*80)\r\n       = 0.6 * (90) + 0.4 * (170)\r\n       = 122 </pre>\r\n<br>\r\nThis solution is contributed <strong>Nitika Bansal</strong>\r\n"},{"id":7421,"question":"Consider the basic block given below. <pre>\r\n  a = b + c\r\n  c = a + d\r\n  d = b + c\r\n  e = d - b\r\n  a = e + b </pre>\r\nThe minimum number of nodes and edges present in the DAG representation of the above basic block respectively are\n","answers":[{"id":29795,"answer":"6 and 6","correct":true},{"id":29796,"answer":"8 and 10","correct":false},{"id":29797,"answer":"9 and 12","correct":false},{"id":29798,"answer":" 4 and 4","correct":false}],"explanation":"<p>Simplifying the given equations :\r\n<br> <br>\r\nd = b + c  (given)      e =  d – b (given)\r\n  =>  d = b + c    and    e = c\r\n<br> <br>\r\ne = d -  b  (given)      a = e + b (given)      \r\n  =>  a = d\r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2015/12/2014-set3-441.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2015/12/2014-set3-441-291x300.jpg\" alt=\"2014-set3-44\" width=\"291\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-22334\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\nThus, the given DAG has 6 nodes and 6 edges.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ab8S2Qs7h8?start=3299\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\nPlease comment below if you find anything wrong in the above post.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>"},{"id":6062,"question":"Which of the following problems is undecidable?","answers":[{"id":24413,"answer":"Deciding if a given context-free grammar is ambiguous.","correct":true},{"id":24414,"answer":"Deciding if a given string is generated by a given context-free grammar.","correct":false},{"id":24415,"answer":"Deciding if the language generated by a given context-free grammar is empty.","correct":false},{"id":24416,"answer":"Deciding if the language generated by a given context-free grammar is finite.","correct":false}],"explanation":"<p>Context free grammar is <strong>not closed under ambiguity</strong>.<em>A set is closed under an operation means when we operate an element of that set with that operator we get an element from that set.</em>\r\nHere, context free grammar generates a context free language and set of all context free languages is also a set. <strong>But, ambiguity is not an operation and hence we can never say that CFG is closed under ambiguity.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Thus, problem mentioned in option (A) is undecidable.</strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrtQIYMB_PY?start=3811\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nPlease comment below if you find anything wrong in the above post.</p>"},{"id":5955,"question":"<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221201114537/GATECS2014Q451.png\" srcset=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221201114537/GATECS2014Q451-660x171.png  660w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221201114537/GATECS2014Q451.png, \" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"300\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Here, w<sup>r</sup> is the reverse of the string w.
