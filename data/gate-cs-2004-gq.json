You can find more info about it here: <a href=\"http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current/html/ethernet.html#capture-effect\">http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current/html/ethernet.html#capture-effec</a>t\r\n\r\nThe solution to the above problem goes like this:\r\n\r\nAt every attempt to transit a frame, both A and B chooses value of 'k' randomly. Based on the value of 'k', back-off time is calculated as a multiple of 'k'. The station or node having the smaller back-off time gets to send the frames eariler.\r\n\r\n1st attempt: Value of 'k' would be k=0 or k=1 (0 <= k <= 2^n-1; where n=nth attempt). Since A won the first race, A must have chosen k=0 and B must have chosen k=1 (A wins here with probability 0.25). As A won, A will again choose k=0 or k=1 for its 2nd frame, but B will choose k=0,1,2 or 3 as B failed to send its first frame in the first attempt.\r\n\r\n2nd attempt: Let kA= value of k chosen by A and kB = value of k chosen by B. We will use notation (kA,kB) to show the possible values. Now the sample space for the 2nd attempt is (kA,kB) = (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2) or (1,3) i.e. 8 possible outcomes. For A to win, kA should be less than kB (kA < kB). Thus, our event space is (kA, kB) = (0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(1,3) i.e. 5 possible outcomes.\r\n\r\nThus the probability that A wins the 2nd back-off race = 5/8 = 0.625\r\n"},{"id":6611,"question":"The routing table of a router is shown below: <pre>\r\n Destination     Sub net mask \t     Interface\r\n 128.75.43.0 \t 255.255.255.0 \t        Eth0\r\n 128.75.43.0 \t 255.255.255.128 \tEth1\r\n 192.12.17.5 \t 255.255.255.255 \tEth3\r\n default \t  \t                Eth2</pre>\r\nOn which interfaces will the router forward packets addressed to destinations 128.75.43.16 and 192.12.17.10 respectively?\n","answers":[{"id":26558,"answer":"Eth1 and Eth2","correct":true},{"id":26559,"answer":"Eth0 and Eth2","correct":false},{"id":26560,"answer":"Eth0 and Eth3","correct":false},{"id":26561,"answer":"Eth1 and Eth3","correct":false}],"explanation":"To find the interface, we need to do AND of incoming IP address and Subnet mask.

So first let us understand what question is asking. So in a book, we have letters A-Z and each letter is printed twice, so there are 52 letters. Now we have to color each letter, so we need a pair of colors for that, because each letter is printed twice. Also in a pair, both colors can be some. Now condition is that a pair of colors can't be used more than once.&nbsp;<br><br>So suppose Mala has 3 colors : Red, Blue, Green. She can color as follows : (A,A) : (Red,Red), (B,B) : (Blue,Blue), (C,C) : (Green,Green), (D,D) : (Red,Blue), (E,E) : (Red,Green), (F,F) : (Blue,Green).&nbsp;<br>Now we don't have more pairs of colors left, we have used all pairs, but could color only 6 letters out of 26. So question is to find minimum no. of colors, so that we could color all 26 letters.&nbsp;<br><br>So if Mala has k colors, she can have k pairs of same colors, thus coloring k letters, then kC2 other pairs of colors, thus coloring kC2 more letters.&nbsp;<br>So total no. of letters colored = k+kC2=k+k(k−1)2=k(k+1)2.&nbsp;<br>So we want k(k+1)2≥26 i.e. k(k+1)≥52, so k≥7, so option <strong>(C) is correct.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"id":5494,"question":"\n<p>In an M'N matrix such that all non-zero entries are covered in a rows and b columns.
