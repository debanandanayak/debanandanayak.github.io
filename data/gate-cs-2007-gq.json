Kernel level threads can also utilize multiprocessor systems by splitting threads on different processors. If one thread blocks it does not cause the entire process to block. Kernel level threads have disadvantages as well. They are slower than user level threads due to the management overhead. Kernel level context switch involves more steps than just saving some registers. Finally, they are not portable because the implementation is operating system dependent.\r\n\r\noption (A): Context switch time is longer for kernel level threads than for user level threads. True, As User level threads are managed by user and Kernel level threads are managed by OS. There are many overheads involved in Kernel level thread management, which are not present in User level thread management.
