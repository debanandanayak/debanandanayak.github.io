Declarative programming focuses on specifying what needs to be done rather than how to do it. In both logic programming and functional programming, the programmer describes the desired result or the properties of the solution without explicitly defining the steps or the order of execution.</p><p>In logic programming languages, such as Prolog, programs are built on a set of logical rules and facts. The programmer defines relationships between entities and the logic engine determines the appropriate answers by performing logical inference.</p><p>Functional programming languages, on the other hand, are based on the concept of functions as first-class entities. Programs are constructed by composing functions and applying them to data. Functional languages emphasize immutability and avoid side effects, allowing for a more declarative and concise programming style.</p><p>While options (A) and (B) are not true for both logic programming and functional programming languages, option (D) is partially correct.

Since the scores are in the range [0..100], and the program is only interested in scores above 50, the possible scores to consider are from 51 to 100.</p><p>Given that the scores range from 51 to 100, there are 50 possible scores in this range. Therefore, using an array of 50 numbers is sufficient to store the frequencies for each score. Each element in the array can correspond to a specific score, where the index represents the score itself, and the value at that index represents the frequency.</p><p>For example, index 0 of the array can represent score 51, index 1 can represent score 52, and so on, up to index 49 representing score 100. By using an array of 50 numbers, the program can directly access the frequency for each score by its corresponding index.</p><p>Using an array of 50 numbers is a compact and efficient way to store the frequencies since it precisely matches the number of distinct scores above 50. It avoids unnecessary memory allocation and provides a direct mapping between scores and frequencies.</p><p>Therefore, the correct explanation is that option (A) An array of 50 numbers is the best way for the program P to store the frequencies of scores above 50.</p><p>See Question 1 of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"/gate-cs-2005-gq/\">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures-and-algorithms-set-22/</a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"/gate-cs-2005-gq/\">Quiz of this Question</a></p>"},{"id":7426,"question":"\n<p>An undirected graph C has n nodes.

And at other times of the clock the output doesn't change. The output of D flip flop is same as input, i.e. Y=Q=D ( at the rising edge ). Now, in the question above, 5 clock periods are given, and we have to find the output Q or Y in those clock periods. First, let's derive the boolean expression for the Logic gate. which is : </span><b><strong>D = AX + X' Q'</strong></b><span> Now, </span><b><strong>In the 1st clock period</strong></b><span>, (i.e. when t = 0 to 1 ) here the clock has rising edge at t= 0, hence at this moment only, D flip flop will change its state. In the 1st clock, &nbsp;X = 1, So, &nbsp;D = A. Now A logic line may have different levels at different clock periods, i.e. may be high or low, therefore we have to answer with respect to the ith clock period where Ai is the logic level ( high or low ) of logic line A in the ith clock. So in the 1st clock period, A logic value should be A1 ( i.e. value of A in 1st clock period), but due to the </span><b><strong>delay provided by the Logic Gates ( Propagation Delay)</strong></b><span> the value of A used by Flip Flop is previous value of A only, i.e.it will capture the value of D resulted by using the logic line A in the 0th clock period, which is A0. Same happens with the value of X, i.e. instead of Xi, previous value of X &nbsp;is used in the in the ith clock period, which is Xi-1. Now, In the 1st clock period value of X is same as in the 0th clock, i.e. logic 1. So, X = 1 ,and A = A0, therefore, D = A0, and hence Q =</span><b><strong> Y = A0</strong></b><span> Similarly we have to do for other clock periods, i.e. instead of taking Ai and Xi, &nbsp;Ai-1 and Xi-1 need to be taken for getting the output in the ith clock period. </span><b><strong>In the 2nd clock period</strong></b><span>, (i.e. when t = 1 to 2 ) X = 1 ( value in the previous clock), So, D = A1 ( value of A in the previous clock) &nbsp;, therefore Q = </span><b><strong>Y = A1</strong></b><span> </span><b><strong>In the 3rd clock period</strong></b><span>, (i.e. when t = 2 to 3 ) X = 0 ( value in the previous clock,see the timing diagram), So, D = Q' = A1' , therefore Q = </span><b><strong>Y = A1'</strong></b><span> &nbsp; ( because of the feedback line ) </span><b><strong>In the 4th clock period</strong></b><span>, (i.e. when t = 3 to 4 ) X = 1 ( value in the previous clock, &nbsp;), So, D = A3 , therefore Q = &nbsp;</span><b><strong>Y = A3</strong></b><span> </span><b><strong>In the 5th clock period</strong></b><span>, (i.e. when t = 4 to 5 ) X = 1 ( value in the previous clock ), so, D = A4 , therefore Q = </span><b><strong>Y = A4</strong></b><span> Hence the output sequence is : </span><b><strong>A0 A1 A1' A3 A4</strong></b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>"},{"id":5828,"question":"<p>The following diagram represents a finite state machine which takes as input a binary number from the least significant bit.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2014/09/GATECS2005Q63.png\"><img src=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2014/09/GATECS2005Q63.png\" alt=\"GATECS2005Q63\" width=\"216\" height=\"91\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13708\" /></a>\r\nWhich one of the following is TRUE?</p>","answers":[{"id":23519,"answer":"It computes 1\\'s complement of the input number","correct":false},{"id":23520,"answer":"It computes 2\\'s complement of the input number","correct":true},{"id":23521,"answer":"It increments the input number","correct":false},{"id":23522,"answer":"It decrements the input number","correct":false}],"explanation":"<p>The given finite state machine takes a binary number from LSB as input.\r\n<br>\r\nThe given FSM remains unchanged till first ‘1’ .
