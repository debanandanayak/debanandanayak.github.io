It is implemented with the help of a counter or timestamp which is set by the sender of the packet and embedded in the packet itself. It represents the maximum lifetime of a packet in the network. When a packet routes through a network, each router checks the current value of its TTL, if the TTL value is not zero then only the router accepts the packet, and decrements its value by 1. This process takes place at every router. If some router founds the TTL value of the incoming packet to be 0, then it simply discards/destroys the packet ( because the lifetime of the packet is over, and hence the packet is not eligible to be in the network ).\r\n\r\nOne of the main purposes of setting the TTL value and doing all this process is to ensure that there is no undelivered packet in the network which is circulating indefinitely, and to avoid the problem of duplicate delivery of the same packet, which may arise in the case of network congestion.\r\n\r\nNow, routing decisions are taken place at the network layer. hence we have to see in the above question that when the packet is going through the network layer.\r\n\r\nLANs work at Data Link Layer only, hence the packet doesn't reach network layer in LANs.\r\n\r\nSo in the question above, Except LANs, at all other points routing decisions have to be taken. Hence TTL value will be checked and manipulated at those points/routers.\r\n\r\nAt Receiver end also, the packet has to go through the network layer so as to reach to application layer, hence Receiver will also check and decrement the TTL value.\r\n\r\nSo there are 6 routers in the above diagram. Initially TTL value was 32, so at the Receiver it will become 32 - 6 = 26.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2015/12/TTL-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21193\" src=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2015/12/TTL-1.jpg\" alt=\"TTL (1)\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"},{"id":3067,"question":"<p>Consider the store and forward packet switched network given below.

Each segment is called a block.  Data in cache is retrieved in form of blocks. The idea is to use Spatial Locality (Once a location is retrieved, it is highly probable that the nearby locations would be retrieved in near future). \r\n\r\nTAG bits : Each cache block is given a set of TAG bits to identify which main memory block is present in that cache block.\r\n\r\nOption A : If the block size is small, there would be less number of near-by address for future references by CPU to be present into that block. Hence this is not better spatial locality.\r\n\r\nOption B : If the block size is smaller, no of blocks would be more in cache, hence more cache tag bits would be needed, not less.\r\n\r\nOption C : Cache tag bits are more ( because more no of blocks due to smaller block size ), but more cache tag bits can't lower the hit time ( even it will increase ).\r\n\r\nOption D : If there is a miss at cache memory ( i.e. the needed block by the CPU is not present in the cache memory ), then that block has to be moved from next lower level of memory ( lets say main memory ) in the memory hierarchy, and if the block size is lower, then it takes less time to be placed into cache memory, hence less miss penalty.\r\n\r\nHence option D.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lz3J33WzNOo?start=2871\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":6403,"question":"<p>If the associativity of a processor cache is doubled while keeping the capacity and block size unchanged, which one of the following is guaranteed to be NOT affected?</p>","answers":[{"id":25741,"answer":"<p>Width of tag comparator</p>","correct":false},{"id":25742,"answer":"<p>Width of set index decoder</p>","correct":false},{"id":25743,"answer":"<p>Width of way selection multiplexer</p>","correct":false},{"id":25744,"answer":"<p>Width of processor to main memory data bus</p>","correct":true}],"explanation":"<p>If associativity is doubled, keeping the capacity and block size constant, then the number of sets gets halved.

There are 3 LCS of length 4 \"qprr\", \"pqrr\" and qpqr &nbsp; A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by selecting zero or more elements from it, without changing the order of the remaining elements. Subsequence need not be contiguous. Since the length of given strings A = “qpqrr” and B = “pqprqrp” are very small, we don’t need to build a 5x7 matrix and solve it using dynamic programming. Rather we can solve it manually just by brute force. We will first check whether there exist a subsequence &nbsp;of length 5 since min_length(A,B) = 5. Since there is no subsequence , we will now check for length 4. “qprr”, “pqrr” and “qpqr” are common in both strings.
