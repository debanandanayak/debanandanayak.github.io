In SRTF, job with the shortest CPU burst will be scheduled first. Because of this process, It may cause starvation as shorter processes may keep coming and a long CPU burst process never gets CPU.\r\n\r\nII) Pre-emptive just means a process before completing its execution is stopped and other process can start execution. The stopped process can later come back and continue from where it was stopped. In pre-emptive scheduling, suppose process P1 is executing in CPU and after some time process P2 with high priority then P1 will arrive in ready queue then p1 is pre-empted and p2 will brought into CPU for execution. In this way if process which is arriving in ready queue is of higher priority then p1, then p1 is always pre-empted and it may possible that it suffer from starvation.\r\n\r\nIII) round robin will give better response time then FCFS ,in FCFS when process is executing ,it executed up to its complete burst time, but in round robin it will execute up to time quantum.

This is a design issue. The operands should be fetched only if they are going to get operated or executed in the next cycle, else there is a possibility of data corruption. As PO stage was not free in the next cycle hence OF was delayed and was done for instruction 1 only just before 1 cycle of going to PO stage.\r\n\r\nInstruction 2 is an ADD operation which take 1 clock cycles of CPU in all stages. But it is a dependent operation. it needs the operands which are provided by Instruction 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nInstruction 2 needs R5 and R2 to add, it gets R2 on time, because till the time Instruction 2 reaches its PO stage R2 would have been stored in memory. Now R5 is also needed, but Instruction 2's PO and Instruction 1's WO are in parallel. That means Instruction 2 can't take the value of R5 before it is stored by Instruction 1. So here comes the concept of Operand Forwarding. Before Instruction 1 store it's result/value which is R5, it can first forward it to instruction 2's Fetch-Execute Buffer, so that Instruction 2 can also use it in parallel to Instruction's WO stage. This will save extra clock cycles required( if Operand forwarding is not used, and R5 need to be taken from memory).\r\n\r\nIn Instruction 3, same operand forwarding concept is applied for the value of R2 which is computed by Instruction 2.\r\n\r\nHence operand forwarding saved 2 extra clock cycles here.

So all 200 values of B must be unique in R. There is no functional dependency given for S. To get the maximum number of tuples in output, there can be two possibilities for S.<br />1) All 100 values of B in S are same and there is an entry in R that matches with this value. In this case, we get 100 tuples in output.<br />2) All 100 values of B in S are different and these values are present in R also. In this case also, we get 100 tuples.</p>"},{"id":4880,"question":"The following program is to be tested for statement coverage: \r\n<pre>\r\nbegin\r\n  if (a== b) {S1; exit;}\r\n  else if (c== d) {S2;]\r\n       else {S3; exit;}\r\n  S4;\r\nend </pre>\r\nThe test cases T1, T2, T3 and T4 given below are expressed in terms of the properties satisfied by the values of variables a, b, c and d.

We'll consider each case separately:\r\n\r\n(1) First digit is 3:\r\nThen the rest of the numbers must come from the list: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4\r\nTherefore we may choose any 3-digit sequence except 222 and 333 for the rest of the digits. This shows there are\r\n3*3*3 - 2 = 25\r\nnumbers in this case.\r\n\r\n(2) First digit is 4:\r\nThen the rest of the numbers must come from the list 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4\r\nTherefore we may choose any 3-digit sequence except 222 for the rest of the digits. This shows there are\r\n3*3*3 - 1 = 26\r\nnumbers in this case.\r\n\r\nNow, the total number is just 25 + 26 = 51.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100216113008AANZGwP\" target=\"_blank\">http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100216113008AANZGwP</a>"},{"id":3715,"question":"\n<p>What does the following program print?<br>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<gfg-tabs data-run-ide=\"false\">\n        <gfg-tab slot=\"tab\">C</gfg-tab>\n        <gfg-panel slot=\"panel\" data-code-lang=\"c\">\n        <code class=\"language-c\"><div class=highlight><pre><span></span><span class=cp>#include</span>\n<span class=kt>void</span><span class=w> </span><span class=nf>f</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=kt>int</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>*</span><span class=n>p</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=kt>int</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>*</span><span class=n>q</span><span class=p>)</span>\n<span class=p>{</span>\n<span class=w>  </span><span class=n>p</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>=</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>q</span><span class=p>;</span>\n<span class=w> </span><span class=o>*</span><span class=n>p</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>=</span><span class=w> </span><span class=mi>2</span><span class=p>;</span>\n<span class=p>}</span>\n<span class=kt>int</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>i</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>=</span><span class=w> </span><span class=mi>0</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>j</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>=</span><span class=w> </span><span class=mi>1</span><span class=p>;</span>\n<span class=kt>int</span><span class=w> </span><span class=nf>main</span><span class=p>()</span>\n<span class=p>{</span>\n<span class=w>  </span><span class=n>f</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=o>&amp;</span><span class=n>i</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>&amp;</span><span class=n>j</span><span class=p>);</span>\n<span class=w>  </span><span class=n>printf</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s>&quot;%d %d </span><span class=se>\\n</span><span class=s>&quot;</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>i</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>j</span><span class=p>);</span>\n<span class=w>  </span><span class=n>getchar</span><span class=p>();</span>\n<span class=w>  </span><span class=k>return</span><span class=w> </span><span class=mi>0</span><span class=p>;</span>\n<span class=p>}</span>\n</pre></div></code>\n        </gfg-panel>\n    </gfg-tabs>\n\n","answers":[{"id":15300,"answer":"<p><span>2 2</span></p>","correct":false},{"id":15301,"answer":"<p><span>2 1</span></p>","correct":false},{"id":15302,"answer":"<p><span>0 1</span></p>","correct":false},{"id":15303,"answer":"<p><span>0 2&nbsp;</span></p>","correct":true}],"explanation":"<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>See below comments for explanation.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>&nbsp;</span></p><pre><span>/* p points to i and q points to j */</span><br><span>void f(int *p, int *q)</span><br><span>{</span><br><span>  p = q;    /* p also points to j now */</span><br><span> *p = 2;   /* Value of j is changed to 2 now */</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre><p><br><span>&nbsp;</span></p>"},{"id":4898,"question":"A system has n resources R<sub data-iceapw=\"1\">0</sub>,...,R<sub data-iceapw=\"1\">n-1</sub>,and k processes P<sub data-iceapw=\"1\">0</sub>,....P<sub data-iceapw=\"1\">k-1</sub>.The implementation of the resource request logic of each process P<sub data-iceapw=\"1\">i </sub>is as follows: \r\n<pre>\r\n if (i % 2 == 0) {\r\n      if (i < n) request R<sub>i</sub>\r\n      if (i+2 < n) request R<sub>i+2</sub>\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n      if (i < n) request R<sub>n-i</sub>\r\n      if (i+2 < n) request R<sub>n-i-2</sub>\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\nIn which one of the following situations is a deadlock possible?","answers":[{"id":19896,"answer":"n=40, k=26","correct":false},{"id":19897,"answer":"n=21, k=12","correct":true},{"id":19898,"answer":"n=20, k=10","correct":false},{"id":19899,"answer":"n=41, k=19","correct":false}],"explanation":"<pre>\r\nOption B is answer\r\n\r\nNo. of resources, n = 21\r\nNo. of processes, k = 12\r\n\r\nProcesses {P0, P1....P11}  make the following Resource requests:\r\n{R0, R20, R2, R18, R4, R16, R6, R14, R8, R12, R10, R10}\r\n\r\nFor example P0 will request R0 (0%2 is = 0 and 0< n=21). \r\n\r\nSimilarly, P10 will request R10.\r\n\r\nP11 will request R10 as n - i = 21 - 11 = 10.\r\n\r\nAs different processes are requesting the same resource, deadlock\r\nmay occur. </pre>\r\n\n"},{"id":4899,"question":"Consider the data given in above question.
